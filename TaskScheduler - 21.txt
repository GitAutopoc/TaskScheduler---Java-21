Problem Statement: Task Dependency Management System

You are tasked with developing a task dependency management system to facilitate the execution of tasks in a specified order based on their dependencies. The system should allow users to define tasks and their dependencies, and then execute the tasks in the correct order.

Requirements:

Task Representation:
Each task is represented by a unique name.
Tasks may have dependencies on other tasks.
Task Dependency Management:
Users should be able to add tasks to the system.
Users should be able to define dependencies between tasks.
Task Execution:
Tasks should be executed in the correct order based on their dependencies.
If a task has dependencies, it should only be executed after all its dependencies have been completed.
Error Handling:
The system should handle errors gracefully, such as invalid task names or dependency definitions.
Functionalities to Implement:

Task Management:
Implement a function to add tasks to the system.
Implement a function to define dependencies between tasks.
Task Execution:
Develop a mechanism to execute tasks in the correct order based on their dependencies.
Ensure that tasks with dependencies are executed only after their dependencies have been completed.
Error Handling:
Implement error handling mechanisms to handle cases such as invalid task names or dependency definitions.
